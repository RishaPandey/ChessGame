# ChessProject instructions

New Chess Game where PAWN elements moves/capture functionality has been implemented taking OOPS concepts into considerations, code refactoring and new test cases. Adding other chess elements in future would be easier due to these implementations.

All simulations take place on a chess board (class name: `ChessBoard`) of size 7 X 7 .

Pieces are either Black or White.  Black pieces typically start at row x=7 and x=6, whereas white pieces typically start at rows x=0 and x=1.  

Pieces can be given two commands: move and capture(although Capture was not a project requirement right now). Each piece has unique movements, but we are going to focus on commands for pawns.  

To run the application, run the Chess.java main class.
